<h3>Introduction</h3>
Introduction
This book is an investigation into cybernetics, automation, AI, cognitive science and physics for the purposes of Information Warfare. Specifically, focusing on the particular area of using neurocognitive science for the purposes of conducting warfare in the battlespace of the mind, information warfare targeting the psyche known as neuroweapons, a biological weapon.
It is a part of cybersecurity studies as it relates to the cybernetics of both machine and animals, in the case of animals using computer based algorithms to influence biological objects. The primary target is the human brain, using scientific technology to alter human organisms and functionality.
Threat Analysis:
Since the end of World War I, the study of EM and Gravitational Waves for the purpose of information warfare has been pursued by global strategic players such as the Nazi Regime in Germany, the USSR, and NATO alliance, while also pursued by the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), while keeping in mind the only country not to ratify treaties banning biological weapons with the technical resources to do it, is Israel (ACA, 2018), which also has a history of conducting espionage against allies like the United States and has recruited many ex-Soviet engineers and is a society based in ethno-religious supremacy (HRW, 2021). State actors are not the only ones that could have this capability as it is available on the black market, as well as any small technically outfitted terrorist group could also accomplish this technology. Indeed, the roots of political deception are found in the intoxication tactics of the 4th Reich inspired Black International. 
The threat of using EM and Gravitoelectromagnetic weapons, of which Ahronov-Bohm (A-B) effect is a party to, was encountered primarily in the 1980s in the USSR. Soviet military-industrial research focused on 'remote biological effects' or remote (non-local, entanglement) influencing using A-B generators designed initially by Akhimov (Kernbach, 2017) around 1986 at least. Later his research associate A V Bobrov experimented with using LEDs with modulated pulsed rhythms for the same purpose. Previous to this Soviet research also focused on using gravitational waves for the purposes of non-local influence, possibly also involving the proposed Gravitational Ahronov-Bohm effect. After the fall of the Soviet Union Soviet researchers were brought to the west to be debriefed, for instance Okhtarin was interviewed by the CIA regarding his research into remote influencing using the Ahronov-Bohm effect. In western parlance remote influencing is known as 'remote action'. When the Russians came west they were employed by Lockheed-Martin to collaborate with their engineers, such as Dr. John Norseen who invented 'Bio-Fusion' and 'Thought-Injection' technology based on previous Soviet inventions. It is also worth noting that this technology is available on the black market according to Dr. Kernbach. Incidents in the Soviet Union targeting the US Embassy using this technology are well documented. And recently the Havana US Embassy incident implicated the use of remote influencing technology as the source of the medical problems encountered by embassy staff (Verma et al, 2019) .    
     The origins of this technology is traced back to the Nazi Regime, from which the Soviets and US-British (UKUSA) alliance received their technology that was later refined and built upon by the winning powers.  In this work I trace out how this technology was developed most importantly paying attention to it’s coupling of biological manipulation with that of computer based cybernetics-- the study of control in machine and animals.  This work is organized into the following chapters:
